## Allocating resources for crime prevention in Chicago for 2024

The dataset used for this project reflects reported incidents of crime, except for murders, that occurred in the City of Chicago starting from 2001. For the scenario where this analysis takes place, the idea is to come up with actionable insights to help the police department allocate resources for crime prevention in Chicago for the year 2024. 
I analysed the historical data up to 2023 and then focused on data referred to last year only.
Here you can see the in-depth analysis in Python and here a brief presentation highlighting insights and positions.

Insights and recommendations are provided in three key areas:

**When?** - Locating the reports in time.

**What?** - The types of crimes reported.

**Where?** - Identifying common areas and locations where incidents occured.
