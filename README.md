## Allocating resources for crime prevention in Chicago for 2024

The [dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m4!1m3!3m2!1sbigquery-public-data!2schicago_crime) used for this project reflects reported incidents of crime, except for murders, that occurred in the City of Chicago starting from 2001. For the scenario where this analysis takes place, the idea is to come up with actionable insights to help the police department allocate resources for crime prevention in Chicago for the year 2024. I analysed the historical data up to 2023 and then focused on data referred to last year only.

For this exercise, the focus was to work on data visualization and storytelling.

Here you can see the in-depth [analysis in Python](https://github.com/renannunes05/Crime-in-Chicago/blob/main/chicago_crime.ipynb) and a brief [presentation](https://github.com/renannunes05/Crime-in-Chicago/blob/main/Crime%20in%20Chicago%20-%20Presentation.pdf)  highlighting insights and positions.

Insights and recommendations are provided in three key areas:

**When?** - Locating the reports in time.

**What?** - The types of crimes reported.

**Where?** - Identifying common areas and locations where incidents occurred.

## Key Takeaways

- The data only represents **reported incidents** of crime. Because of that, **campaigns** encouraging people to **report on classically unreported or underreported crimes** can help paint a clear picture.
  
- That is a correlation with times when more people are circulating. Making efforts in the direction of **increasing police patrol and remote surveillance** in busy areas can reduce crimes of opportunity.

- 36% of the most common crimes happen in public areas. **Improving the physical conditions**, such as street lighting, can make safer urban spaces, reducing opportunities for common crimes like theft.
  
- Crime is unevenly distributed throughout the city, with half of the communities representing around 73% of reports. **Allocating resources in the right areas** is crucial when planning effective measures.
